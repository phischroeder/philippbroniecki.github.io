	Availability, collection and access to quantitative data, as well as its limitations, often make qualitative data the resource upon which development programs heavily rely. Both traditional interview data and social media analysis can provide rich contextual information and are essential for research, appraisal, monitoring and evaluation. These data may be difficult to process and analyze both systematically and at scale. This, in turn, limits the ability of timely data driven decision-making which is essential in fast evolving complex social systems. In this paper, we discuss the potential of using natural language processing to systematize analysis of qualitative data, and to inform quick decision-making in the development context. We illustrate this with interview data generated in a format of micro-narratives for the UNDP Fragments of Impact project.

	<p><strong>Against the Odds: Implausible Outcomes and Timing in EU Legislative Decision-Making</strong><br />

	<blockquote>
	How can the Union legislate despite profound ideological disagreement among its members? We seek to contribute to a debate that points to a culture of compromise and accommodation on the one hand, and to the joint decision trap and ideological left-right political conflict on the other. Our data covers the population of concluded codecision files from 1999 to 2014 that either amended or replaced existing legislation. For such files, we are able to approximate the status quo ante on the general left-right dimension by estimating the policy positions of the relevant legislators who set the reference point through the original legislation. We show that a significant share of concluded legislation should have been defeated by the status quo at the time of the adoption of the proposal and/or of the final legislative act, and is hence implausible. In line with our theoretical expectation, we demonstrate that a meta-preference for cooperation facilitates implausible legislation, but such outcomes against the odds become less likely over time as politicisation increases. Furthermore, we test whether file and context-level properties, such as policy-type, salience, complexity and collective impatience can explain why the EUâ€™s legislative process is less deadlocked than we might expect.

	<p><strong>Improved Multilevel Regression with Post-Stratification through Optimal Model Selection</strong><br />

	<blockquote>
	Multilevel regression with post-stratification (MrP) has become a standard approach for small area estimation problems. After an initially largely positive reception in the literature, there are now also more critical contributions which show that MrP does not always perform optimally. One inherent problem is how to select the appropriate response model and specifically how to include the context-level information in an optimal fashion. We formulate this as a prediction problem and explore various simple approaches from the statistical learning literature as well as model averaging approaches. We show that a disciplined approach provides an improvement. The size of this improvement will depend on how well non-systematically specified models can perform.

	<p><strong>Power and Transparency in Political Negotiations</strong><br />
	Under review.

	<blockquote>
	This article argues that transparency affects power in political negotiations. The more secretive actor has an advantage over the more transparent one. This is of concern for the design of political institutions and for assessing their balance of power. Legislative chambers in bicameral systems can often choose rules regarding their transparency themselves, making it a choice between legitimacy and influence. The European Union provides the setting for testing that link. Treaty changes allowed one legislative chamber to become less transparent in informal and early negotiations. Meanwhile, the opposing chamber remained unaffected. A new measure of relative influence is developed which captures the expectations from veto player theory more accurately. The theory is tested on 140 salient pieces of legislation, finding a strong and robust link between transparency and power.
