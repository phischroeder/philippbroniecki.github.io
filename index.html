	<h2>Welcome</h2>
	<p>I am a PhD candidate at the School of Public Policy, Department of Political Science, University College London. I research legislative politics with a focus on the European Union. My work relates to the effects of institutional design on decision making.</p>
	<p>In my dissertation, I look at informal decision making – the modus operandi in the EU – and ask whether it is a representative way of legislating or whether we should expect agency drift. My related work on the EU is about the inter-institutional balance of power, explaining unlikely legislation – the lack of gridlock – and improving measurement methods for concepts such as influence and support for integration.</p>
	<p>I am passionate about developing, applying, and teaching quantitative methods for political science. Currently, I am involved in a project on using machine learning techniques to better estimate subnational public opinion and a project that uses quantitative text analysis to analyse open-ended survey questions collected by development organizations. I teach the introduction to quantitative methods module for master students at the School of Public Policy and advice human rights/civil liberties NGOs on research methodology.</p>
